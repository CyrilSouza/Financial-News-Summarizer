       "\"A wealthy Aussie has narrowly avoided losing $25 million after “several red” flags went off indicating it was an investment scam. Daniel Smith* had received a phone call from what he believed was a reputable bank, offering him an attractive term-deposit rate. He decided to contact his current bank, NAB, to see if they could match the offer.

A NAB banker also recently stopped a Tasmanian couple from losing $40,000 to an investment scam, which promised a 12 per cent return on their term deposit and a guaranteed payout if the firm went bust. ASIC says fraudsters will often pretend to be from a financial services company or bank offering low-risk investment products, such as government bonds or fixed-term loans. “Because scammers impersonate real investment providers in these scams, they can be convincing,” ASIC’s MoneySmart said.

       "{'GME': ['Before everybody goes nuts over here and calls me an overzealous wannabe that must have just watched “Dumb Money” I want to hammer home the fact that this has nothing to do with Roaring Kitty. Really, it’s just based on facts and actions taken by analysts on Wall Street that Zacks happens to aggregate. All-in-all, it’s a great way to highlight the Zacks Rank by pointing out the action in today’s Bull of the Day, GameStop (GME).  GameStop Corp., a specialty retailer, provides games and entertainment products through its stores and ecommerce platforms in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The company sells new and pre-owned gaming platforms; accessories, such as controllers, gaming headsets, and virtual reality products; new and pre-owned gaming software; and in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content, and full-game downloads. It also sells collectibles comprising apparel, toys, trading cards, gadgets, and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts, as well as engages in the digital asset wallet and NFT marketplace activities. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Retail – Consumer Electronics industry which ranks in the Top 5% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the strong rank is that two analysts have come out over the last week and increased their earnings estimates for both the current year and next year. The bullish move has catapulted the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate from a 17-cent loss to just a 2-cent loss. That now represents growth of 98% over last year. Next year’s number is up from a 20-cent loss to just a 5-cent loss. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research A quick look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart on GameStop shows that estimates and the stock’s price has been moving in opposite directions. Since the end of 2022, estimates have trended in a singular direction, up. At the same time, the stock has come down from near $30 to the $15 level it sits at today. That sort of divergence between earnings and price will not last forever. Either earnings will come down',\n",
       "  \"GameStop (GME) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for GameStop is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For GameStop, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks\",\n",

After a long day, some of us want to just watch TV, play video games, listen to music, or scroll through our phones; electronics and gaming retailers sell the technology that makes this possible, plus more. Shoppers can find everything from surround-sound speakers to gaming controllers to home appliances in their stores. Competitive prices and helpful store associates that can talk through topics like the latest technology in gaming and installation keep customers coming back. This is a category that has moved rapidly online over the last few decades, so these electronics and gaming retailers have needed to be nimble and aggressive with their e-commerce and omnichannel investments. GameStop is a mid-sized retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better economies of scale. On the other hand, it has an edge over smaller competitors with fewer resources and can still flex high growth rates because it's growing off a smaller base than its larger counterparts. As you can see below, the company's revenue has declined over the last four years, dropping 6.1% annually. This quarter, GameStop reported a rather uninspiring 9.1% year-on-year revenue decline, missing Wall Street's expectations.

       "  \"GameStop (GME) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 19.4% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier. How to Determine if a Stock is Oversold We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Here's Why GME Could Experience a Turnaround The RSI reading of 29.62 for GME is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for GME has increased 30.8%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, GME currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means\",\n",

       " 'TSLA': [\"Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped to new multi-week lows as slowing China shipments and new price cuts there hint at troubles for the EV stalwart in the world’s largest car market. Tesla reported 60,365 vehicle shipments from its Giga Shanghai factory in February, according to preliminary data from China’s PCA (Passenger Car Association) via Bloomberg. The February shipments represent a 16% drop from a month ago, a 19% drop from a year ago, and the lowest shipment total since December 2022. Tesla shares closed down 7.16%, its lowest close since Feb. 13. The Chinese Lunar Holiday, during which the country shuts down for nearly two weeks, fell in February of this year. Historically, this has led to depressed economic activity and sales in the country. In addition, Tesla uses earlier months in the quarter to fulfill shipments outside of China and generally ramps up shipments later in the quarter for China domestic sales. But Tesla’s lowest shipment total in over a year is a concern for the company, which sees China as a huge growth market. Even China’s BYD, which surpassed Tesla in overall EV sales in Q4 and generally dominates the Chinese EV market, saw its February sales tumble to 122,311 units from 193,655, a 37% drop. China now sells the most EVs in the world, but a recent slowdown in demand for EVs has led automakers there to engage in another price war earlier this year — and this includes Tesla. According to a report from Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner published on Monday, Tesla's latest incentives on the mainland include the “equivalent of ~$4.8K price cut to customers who purchase from existing inventories of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by the end of March.” Rosner said the new incentives include insurance discounts, discounts on paint changes, and preferential financing plans on the Model Y. The latest incentives come after Tesla cut prices in January for the Model 3 and Model Y by 5.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The competition is fierce in China’s EV market, and Tesla having to cut prices and possibly reduce shipments is definitely a concern\",\n",

Maybe it will help their margins. How long, though, the key price is there-- that, of course, is a question, too. And how the rest of the industry responds, as well.

       "  \"The stock market is soaring yet again. But this time, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is not leading the charge. In fact, the market is up in spite of the electric vehicle (EV) leader. Tesla shares have fallen a whopping 34% year to date (YTD) as of this writing, while the Nasdaq-100 continues to rise. The stock is now off 60% from all-time highs, while the broad market is close to all-time highs. We are at another crossroads with Tesla stock. Bulls will argue this is a perfect buying opportunity as the company prepares for its next leg of growth. Bears will argue the company is finally heading toward a normal valuation that a manufacturing-based business deserves to trade at. Which group is right? Where will Tesla stock be in three years? Tesla continued to grow its unit volumes in 2023. It delivered 1.8 million cars to customers around the globe, up from 1.3 million in 2022 and 936,000 in 2021. This is impressive growth at scale, making Tesla one of the premier manufacturers of not just EVs, but cars in general. For reference, the largest automaker in the world is Toyota, which produces just over 10 million cars every year. But to get this unit growth, Tesla has had to lower its prices. Its main products have evolved to the cheaper Model 3 and Y products, which go for less than its older X and S models. On top of this, Tesla has chosen -- or perhaps been forced -- to lower prices on the Model 3 and Y to grow unit volumes. We can see this dynamic in the price of used Teslas, which have collapsed by half from a relative peak in early 2022. Lower prices have translated to slowing revenue growth and lower margins. In 2023, Tesla's revenue grew by 19% to $97 billion, but slowed down to just 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Gross margins slipped from 25.6% in 2022 to 18.2% in 2023, with operating income falling 35% for the year. Margins are deteriorating as Tesla goes for a greater global scale. In order to\",\n",

High-flying Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 1%, while Tesla (TSLA) fell over 4.5% after a Wells Fargo downgrade and sales warning.

       "  'Industrials, consumer discretionary lead S&P 500 rally; Reddit shares jump on debut Written by Aditya Raghunath at The Motley Fool Canada Enbridge (TSX:ENB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are large-cap companies that have generated massive wealth for long-term shareholders. While Enbridge has a market cap of $103 billion, Tesla is a much larger company with a market cap of $553 billion. Let’s see if there is a chance for Enbridge stock to be worth more than Tesla by 2026. Shares of Tesla are down 58% from all-time highs as the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer continues to wrestle with rising competition, a sluggish macro environment, and slower consumer spending. Tesla is among the largest EV manufacturers globally and it shipped 1.8 million cars in 2023, up from 1.3 million in 2022 and 936,000 in 2021. However, in the last few quarters, Tesla has lowered vehicle prices to boost demand, thereby impacting its profit margins and cash flow. Lower prices have led to a slowing of top-line growth and an erosion of profit margins. While Tesla’s sales rose by 19% to US$97 billion in 2023, it decelerated to just 3% in the December quarter. Moreover, its gross margins narrowed to 18.2% in 2023 from 25.6% in 2022, while operating income declined by 35% year over year. Analysts expect Tesla’s adjusted earnings per share to narrow from US$3.12 in 2023 to US$2.99 per share in 2024. So, the stock is priced at 60 times forward earnings, which is quite steep. Wall Street remains bullish on Tesla stock and expects shares to surge over 15% in the next 12 months. Armed with a wide economic moat, Enbridge is an energy infrastructure behemoth that transports commodities across North America. It charges a fee for companies that use its assets, resulting in stable cash flows across market cycles. Additionally, it owns a natural gas utility business and renewable energy assets, diversifying its revenue base. Enbridge pays shareholders an annual dividend of $3.66 per share, translating to a forward yield of 7.6%. These payouts have risen by 10% annually in the last 29 years, showcasing the resiliency of the',\n",

There’ll be zero growth in sales volumes for the electric-vehicle maker this year, Wells Fargo’s Colin Langan said. And in 2025, it’ll be worse yet: volumes will drop. Shares of the company reacted appropriately, dropping 4.5% to close at a 10-month low of $169.5 on Wednesday. The stock has now fallen 32% this year, missing out on a broader rally that has pushed the S&P 500 Index up 8.3%. The reason is clear: Tesla’s ability to grow at the furious pace that its expensive valuation promises is no longer a guarantee. The company still trades at a multiple that is significantly higher than other mega-cap high-flyers, yet the pace of expansion in its revenue and profit have slowed markedly since last year. “Right now, the market is voting and telling us that it believes Tesla does not currently deserve that high valuation,” Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview. “For now, the sellers are in control and the market needs a bullish catalyst to get excited about.” Wall Street has been ringing the alarm bell loudly on Tesla since the beginning of March, after disappointing numbers from China, data from European countries and a production disruption at its factory near Berlin pointed to first-quarter deliveries missing analysts’ average expectations. Musk’s response — lowering prices to boost demand — is losing its edge as well. Wells Fargo’s Langan was the latest to note that the company’s growth in its core markets has',\n",

Some on Wall Street say it is quite difficult to estimate the future price of bitcoin because it has no intrinsic value, and most big firms with large research arms are currently staying away from setting targets. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has likened it to a \"pet rock.\" \"Bitcoin is like art,\" said a Wall Street research analyst who requested anonymity. \"There\\'s no way to come up with a target.” That hasn’t stopped other financial firms from trying — and setting the price significantly higher than it is today. Some of the companies making these predictions also sell products that provide investors with exposure to the digital asset. One is VanEck, among the money managers that received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission in January to launch a new spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. VanEck recently scrapped its $80,000 target for 2024 as bitcoin began hitting new all-time highs in the past week.

       "  \"MicroStrategy Inc., led by Chairman Michael Saylor, has made considerable investments in Bitcoin over the past several years.

In early March, it sold $700 million worth of convertible bonds intending to use the funds to buy more Bitcoin. Many were awaiting the details of the purchase, which were released on March 18.

MicroStrategy bought an additional 9,245 Bitcoin for around $623 million using the funds from the convertible notes. The tokens were bought at an average price of $67,382. The transactions brought MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 214,246. The entire position was acquired for around $7.5 billion or $35,160 per token. The position is up nearly 100%, creating roughly $6.2 billion in unrealized gains. MicroStrategy has long been the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin. However, this recent buy marked a huge milestone in the company's position. With the most recent buy, the company now holds 1.02% of the Bitcoin supply that will exist, and the percentage could be higher based on different assumptions. The total supply of Bitcoin is continuously growing but at a decreasing rate because of Bitcoin halvings. The supply reaches 21 million tokens in about 2140. Today, around 19.7 million tokens are in circulation. If you use this number for the supply of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy holds 1.08% of available tokens. Another view on the supply is that some wallets have been lost, meaning that the Bitcoin inside of them is effectively gone.

First and foremost, for people who are trying to figure out if this is now the right time to dip the toe into this crypto rally, what would you say to them? COSMO JIANG: Yeah, for sure. Well, first, thanks for having me. I\\'d say step one is really just go from 0% to 1%. You know, if we look at-- Coinbase has done a survey recently, and they\\'ve discovered that roughly 20% of Americans own crypto. So there\\'s actually a lot of people who are at 0% right now. And it\\'s going from 0% to',\n",
       "  'US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday, pulling further away from record highs as uncertainty over interest rate cuts and a shakeup in \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks brought a note of wariness to the market. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the day\\'s declines, sinking about 1.7% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down more than 1%. Apple came under pressure after a report that iPhone sales fell 24% in China, adding to Monday\\'s loss in the wake of a $2 billion EU antitrust fine. Tesla continued to slump as a shutdown at its Berlin Gigafactory added to concerns over a shipment slump and a Chinese price war. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) reached a fresh all-time high, briefly surpassing its previous record of $68,789 from November 2021. However, the cryptocurrency experienced a sizable drop shortly after, plummeting 10% to trade just around $62,000 a coin. The debate now is whether the tech gains behind the recent record-setting stock rally have reached their peak, as downbeat news saps the \"FOMO\" — fear of missing out — seen as keeping investors engaged. At the same time, faith in coming easing by the Federal Reserve took a knock after comments by policymaker Raphael Bostic. The Atlanta Fed president said he sees just one rate cut this year, penciled in for the third quarter. Investors are now even more focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\\'s testimony to Congress on Wednesday. His words will be closely watched for any change in the mantra that policymakers need to be convinced inflation is conquered before any move. In corporates, Target (TGT) earnings beat Wall Street forecasts, helping shares pop more than 10%. Shares of CrowdStrike jumped 17% after the cybersecurity firm reported quarterly earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines and issued stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter. CrowdStrike projected first quarter adjusted earnings between $0.89 and $0.90 a share, ahead of the $0.82 estimate analysts had expected. The company\\'s',\n",
       "  \"Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a “halving,” which cuts the daily supply of newly minted coins by 50%—an event that's historically caused prices to soar. As the next halving rapidly approaches, on or around April 19, investors are waiting to see whether this familiar pattern is repeated. Bitcoin has already climbed 60% this year, reaching an all-time high of over $72,000 in March. This has been driven by investors flocking to newly launched ETFs that allow them to buy Bitcoin in the form of shares on a stock exchange. But it’s also likely because markets know diminished supply from the halving could rally demand, and if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could outdo its 2021 bull run by a significant margin. Here’s Fortune’s plain English guide to the Bitcoin halving: what it is, why it matters, and how it could affect the price of the original cryptocurrency. Every time a new block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain, the contributor is given some Bitcoins as a reward. This “block reward” initially consisted of 50 bitcoins but, due to a feature of Bitcoin’s code, that amount is cut in half every four years. Previous halvings saw the block reward cut to 25 Bitcoins, then to 12.5, then to the current allotment of 6.25. The halving set for April will see the reward cut to 3.125. #Bitcoin Halving is near 32 days more to go.... pic.twitter.com/M8HTDu8y5l — Budhil Vyas (@BudhilVyas) March 19, 2024 Blocks are added by miners, which typically fall into three categories: retail (individuals with computers), industrial (often publicly traded, operating data farms), and mining pools (groups of miners who combine efforts over a network). Anyone can be a miner and eligible for rewards—which are issued every 10 minutes or so—if they download the Bitcoin program and run it on their computers. Rewards go to whomever is first to solve a complex math problem using trial-and-error calculations on a specialized computer. The mining is an integral part of updating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and keeping the network secure. Halvings occur after 210,000 blocks are created—roughly every four years.\\xa0It’s not possible\",\n",
       "  \"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened lower on Tuesday thanks to a decline in tech stocks and concerns about when the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates. It's a different story for bitcoin (BTC-USD), however, with the cryptocurrency notching a new all-time high. Alibaba (BABA) shares are on the move. The Chinese internet giant is one of the companies investing in Chinese AI startup MiniMax, according to a report from Bloomberg. Stitch Fix (SFIX) shares are trading lower after posting a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. The online styling company also cut its full-year sales outlook. AT&T (T) received an upgrade to Outperform from Peer Perform at Wolfe Research, which cites the telecom's fundamentals and the fact that it's paying down debt and becoming more efficient. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) are falling sharply after announcing a new debt offering. Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down some of Tuesday's trending tickers.

BRAD SMITH: Let's take a look at how things are shaping up. Stocks are lower pulling further back from record highs as uncertainty over interest rate cuts. And the continued strength of tech stocks brought a note of wariness to the market here. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is taking center stage surging past $68,000. And we'll see if it can hit a new all-time high today here as well. SEANA SMITH: All right. Let's take a look at some of those individual trending tickers, first up Alibaba investing in Chinese AI startup MiniMax. Now this is according to Bloomberg. MiniMax has secured funds from Alibaba and other investors at a valuation of over 2 and 1/2 billion dollars. Now Alibaba emulating moves of companies such as Microsoft and betting on artificial intelligence. This being Alibaba's second major deal in the space this year that it's spearheading. You could see the move up just about 7/10 of a percent. BRAD SMITH: And taking a look on the earnings front, Stitch\",\n",

       "  'Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is one of the center focuses on Wall Street this week as the cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high above $72,000 per coin. While many investors are thrilled, some investors are cautious due to the extremely volatile nature of the asset. Mizuho Americas Senior Financial Technology Analyst Dan Dolev and Matt Ballensweig, BitGo Managing Director and Head of Go Network, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how investors can take advantage of the recent bitcoin rally. Dolev actually starts by warning investors to stay away from crypto investing: \"Let\\'s talk about Coinbase (COIN) specifically, they are a take-rate business. And take rates are always bound to be a race to the bottom. And eventually, there\\'s going to be more competition and they are already getting out pricing concessions. In January, they gave out a pricing concession for people who are trading 500,000 or above. So pricing pressure is starting and competition is heating up. So the fact that I don\\'t believe in the underlying currency — bitcoin — that\\'s one thing, but irrespective of that, I think Coinbase is that minus take-rate pressure and competition.\" Ballensweig explains his bullish stance on the digital asset: \"Institutions are starting to pile in through the nine new bitcoin ETFs. And the flows really don\\'t lie here, there is demand for BTC as an asset. BlackRock through the IBIT ETF (IBIT) did $2 billion in volume yesterday. In total, the ETFs now hold over $55 billion in just their first 60 days of trading. So the flows really don\\'t lie here.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

       "\"The stock market is soaring yet again. But this time, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is not leading the charge. In fact, the market is up in spite of the electric vehicle (EV) leader. Tesla shares have fallen a whopping 34% year to date (YTD) as of this writing, while the Nasdaq-100 continues to rise. The stock is now off 60% from all-time highs, while the broad market is close to all-time highs. We are at another crossroads with Tesla stock. Bulls will argue this is a perfect buying opportunity as the company prepares for its next leg of growth. Bears will argue the company is finally heading toward a normal valuation that a manufacturing-based business deserves to trade at. Which group is right? Where will Tesla stock be in three years? Tesla continued to grow its unit volumes in 2023. It delivered 1.8 million cars to customers around the globe, up from 1.3 million in 2022 and 936,000 in 2021. This is impressive growth at scale, making Tesla one of the premier manufacturers of not just EVs, but cars in general. For reference, the largest automaker in the world is Toyota, which produces just over 10 million cars every year. But to get this unit growth, Tesla has had to lower its prices. Its main products have evolved to the cheaper Model 3 and Y products, which go for less than its older X and S models. On top of this, Tesla has chosen -- or perhaps been forced -- to lower prices on the Model 3 and Y to grow unit volumes. We can see this dynamic in the price of used Teslas, which have collapsed by half from a relative peak in early 2022. Lower prices have translated to slowing revenue growth and lower margins. In 2023, Tesla's revenue grew by 19% to $97 billion, but slowed down to just 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Gross margins slipped from 25.6% in 2022 to 18.2% in 2023, with operating income falling 35% for the year. Margins are deteriorating as Tesla goes for a greater global scale. In order to\""
